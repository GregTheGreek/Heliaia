# Heliaia

Heliaia is a proxy that sits between your wallet and a node, with the sole purpose to intercept transactions before they are broadcasted. Transactions are thuroughly analysed by various rules that provide the user with deep insights into what they are signing. Wallet UIs can only present you with so much information before it becomes exhaustive. Heliaia aims to provide a user with an indepth analysis of their transactons to help them make a more informed decision when signing transactions.

TL/DR: If you're paranoid like me, this is the sanity check you need.

## Name Origins

Heliaia was the supreme court of ancient Athens, the Heliaia functioned as a court for litigation of public, criminal and private international law. A fitting name for a tool that scrutinizes a transaction to ensure it adhers to a strict set of rules. I'm also Greek and chose this purely on bias :)

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/GregTheGreek/Heliaia.git
cd Heliaia
yarn
yarn start [args]
```

Available command line arguments:

```
Options:
  -r --rpc <url>      RPC URL to proxy to (default: "http://localhost:8545/")
  -p --port <number>  Port number to listen on (default: "9545")
  -h, --help          display help for command
```

Once started, connect your wallet (eg, MetaMask) to the endpoint exposed by the proxy (by default, http://localhost:9545/), and interact with apps and contracts normally.

When rules are run, they'll appear in the terminal like so:

```
Do you want to submit the transaction?
